# Glowing Title
* Thanks to Farrow's site for the code.
* Including the class in the title in `_config.yml` breaks.
* In `_includes/default/navbar.liquid` `site.title` couldn't be altered without affecting other behaviours of the theme. 
* So _liquid_ code was used there to create a new variable `hltitle` with hl-html class for this specific use only.
* css is included in `_sass/custom.scss` file created and this custom was included in `_sass/type-on-strap.scss` as `@import 'custom';` 
* Whoa!!! It works

# Breadcrumb without plugin
* Create the file `_includes/breadcrumbs.html`.
* In `_includes/default/navbar.liquid` inject the liquid command at appropriate place. \`{% include breadcrumbs.html %}\`
* But it reads and breaks the permalink, so not accurate.
* Gets space that is extra without any good functions.
* Let's discard it.

# Latex css 
* Inclusion in head.liquid though works, breaks the theme features, but do not crashes, at least!

# Including google font
* link style sheet in _`includes/default/head.liquid`.
* `<link href="fonts.googleapis.com" rel="stylesheet">` didn't work for sofia?
* `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Sofia">` Worked for Sofia print.
* Set in `_sass/base/_variables.scss` set the first choice to 'Sofia' before fall backs for `font-family-logo` variable of the theme that sets fonts for site title and subtitle. 
* Done in this line `$font-family-logo: 'Sofia','Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;`

# Printing pdf nicely
* @print defined properly in `_sass/base/_global.scss` .
* Note to keep colour black, font latexish Charter family.

# Portfolio making
* Based on Portfolio for projects that has a special page with projects in a folder `_portfolio`, a new item can be designed for other purpose.
* How it's done?
 - Create a file in _pages_ named _PhyUtkal_ like _portfolio.md_
 - This may contain it's own content. 
 - It will automatically fetch the pages from `_PhyUtkal` folder and arrange images in a grid and clickable.
 - Each page in the source folder will have it's detailed content. Here, we use paper details. 
 - Now there can be no subfolder? create pages for individual papers and then link them to this page.
    
# Jekyll theme
* If using remote-theme options for any reason, better to avoid liquid tags extesively.
* Own data in 'pages', `_posts`, portfolio folders, custom css scripts etc. must be retained carefully.
* Theme specific example posts and pages may be avoided and removed for other theme breakdown.
