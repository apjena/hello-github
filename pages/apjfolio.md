## test apj Portfolio forked by name apjfolio
can it be renamed to say, questions/cbcs policies etc. 
to group all Semester wise questions.
can we have another stuff like this with other name say study materials, and have it's own folios. with that name grouped in that folder _study Materials like existing example _portfolio. 

More importantly, this type of *introductory texts* is allowed or not.

To see: linking in markdown note taking, not possible randomly. The whole folder perhaps has to be imported so that jekyll creates all the links!!!
{% include apjfolio.html %}
